        <h1>How To Monetize Photography Passion</h1>

        <h3>Sup bro</h3>
        <p>So, I think we should consider tangibly moving forward 
            with our passion for taking photos. We've previously touched 
            on what we can do in order to make this a reality. However let 
            me go over it again for us both. 
        </p>

        <h2>Potential Action Plan for the New Year (2023)</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Really nail down if this is something we want to do.</li>
            <li>If so, we need to determine when we can realistically start.</li>
            <li>We also need to ask ourselves: what type of photography should we offer?</li>
        </ul>
        And now... the order in which things(I think at least) should be done.

        <ol>
            <li>Work on some type of graphic. It can be as simple or as complicated as necessary.</li>
            <li>Post it on our social media. Talk about it to everybody.</li>
            <li>Wait for friends/family to contract us.</li>
            <li>Repeat as necessary :D</li>

        </ol>
