        <p>Okay, so you may be wondering how to properly love a Corgi,
            more specfically the bestest gorl named Millie. Keep reading
            and I'll be sure to describe in the most detail possible how 
            to achieve this, and how to keep nurturing that sacred love.
        </p>

        <h2>Things to Consider Beforehand</h2>
        In order to guarantee the most optimal results possible, we need to ask ourselves a few things.
        <ul>
            <li>Has Millie had some breakfast/dinner?</li>
            <li>Was Millie taken out to the bathroom recently?</li>
            <li>Has she had some playtime with her boyfriend and or 
                has some physical exercise today?
            </li>
        </ul>

        If you said yes to all of the above, congrats. Please continue.

        <h2>Onto the Actual Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Get Millie's attention, preferably by calling her name.</li>
            <li>Have a treat ready because she's such a good gorl.</li>
            <li><strong>Highly</strong> consider vocalizing a happy tone, 
                so whatever you're telling her, sound happy.</li>
            You have a few options available:
            <li>If you're not the physicaly affectionate type, you're done! Congrats!</li>
            <li>If you are/can be physically affectionate, hug Millie or pet her lovingly.</li>
        </ol>
    That's it! You're well on your way to developing a stronger bond with Millie!
